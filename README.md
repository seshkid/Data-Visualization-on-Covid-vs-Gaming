# Covid19 vs. Gaming on Steam Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of gamers on Steam.

# Overview
The analysis attempts to draw a correlation between the global rise in COVID-19 cases and an increase in the number of concurrent users on the Steam platform. The main sections of the notebook include:

- Importing Modules: Necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization are imported.
- Data Conversion: Conversion of external data sources into a structured format for analysis.
- Data Loading: Datasets related to worldwide COVID-19 tests and Steam's peak concurrent users are loaded.
- Data Cleaning: Preprocessing and cleaning steps to ensure data integrity.
- Data Visualization: Graphical representation of the data to identify trends and patterns.

 # Datasets
The analysis utilizes two primary datasets:

- Tested Worldwide: Contains data related to COVID-19 tests conducted globally.
- Steam Peak Concurrent Users: Represents the peak number of concurrent gamers on Steam over time.

# Key Findings

## Early 2020:

- **US COVID Tests:** 
  - As expected, there's a noticeable increase in the number of tests conducted during the early stages of the pandemic.
- **Steam Users:** 
  - There's an initial decline in the growth of Steam users. This could be attributed to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, such as economic uncertainties, lockdowns, and adjustments to remote work.

## Mid to Late 2020:

- **US COVID Tests:** 
  - The increase in tests becomes more gradual as testing capabilities expand and stabilize.
- **Steam Users:** 
  - After the initial decline, there's a surge in Steam users around mid-2020, which might be due to people turning to gaming as a leisure activity during prolonged lockdowns.

## 2021:

- **US COVID Tests:** 
  - The number of tests conducted each month remains relatively stable.
- **Steam Users:** 
  - The growth in Steam users shows some fluctuations but remains positive.
